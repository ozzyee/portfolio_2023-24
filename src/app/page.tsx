							 <br/>
							 <p>
								 I'm Oscar, a passionate software engineer with a love for technology since childhood. Despite my first
								 encounter with computers at 7, I didn't code until 2019 after a pandemic-induced career shift from chef
								 to software engineering. My initial project, a website for a friend, sparked my interest in web
								 development, driving me to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
							 </p>
							 <br/>
							 <p>
								 Eager to expand my skills, I self-learned advanced technologies like React and Node.js, mastering
								 databases along the way. Seeking structured learning, I enrolled in a bootcamp, deepening my expertise
								 and helping others navigate software engineering complexities. This decision marked a pivotal moment in
								 my ongoing growth and expertise acquisition.
